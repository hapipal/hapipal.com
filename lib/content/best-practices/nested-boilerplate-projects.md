# Nested boilerplate projects

The pal [boilerplate](link:boilerplate) is a proven starting point for your next hapi project, but did you know it also exposes your app as a Hapi plugin?

Hapi plugins are a super-power, and combining them with the pal [tooling](link:tooling) is a perfect way to contain & compose API verticals.

The following diagram is an example of how multiple APIs, all built with [boilerplate](link:boilerplate) can create the fictional service _My Awesome Project_.
